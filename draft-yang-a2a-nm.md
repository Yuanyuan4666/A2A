# Conventions and Definitions

- AI Agent: A software system or program that is capable of autonomously performing goals and tasks on behalf of a user or another system.
- Agent Card: A common metadata file that describes an agent's capabilities, skills, interface URLs, and authentication requirements. Clients discover and identify the agent through this file.
- A2A server: An AI agent that receives requests and performs tasks
- A2A client: An AI agent that sends requests to servers

# Overview of key challenges for the network management

In large scale network management environment, a large number of devices from different vendors need to be uniformly managed, which can lead to the following issues:

## Limitations of Unified AI Agents in Heterogeneous NETCONF/YANG Environments

Vendor implementations of YANG models and NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols exhibit significant divergence. A unified AI agent trained with homogeneous datasets and operating within fixed contextual frameworks inherently fails to adapt to vendor-specific device behaviors, resulting in suboptimal management performance, primarily due to:

- **Overgeneralized Training Data**: Single training corpus cannot capture all vendor implementations

- **Inflexible Contextual Frameworks**: Static operational contexts cannot accommodate device-specific nuances

## Operational Inefficiencies in Multi-Device Management Scenarios

In multi-device operational environments, critical workflows including:

- Fault diagnosis
- Traffic monitoring
- Security enforcement

often require engineers to:

- Manually collect and correlate logs across devices
- Perform root cause analysis without cross-device context
- Validate solutions through iterative device-by-device testing
- Act as human intermediaries for inter-device communication

This approach introduces significant operational inefficiencies and suboptimal human resource utilization.
