1.  Introduction

   With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the concept of
   AI agents has gradually attracted significant attention.  An AI agent
   refers to a category of software applications that utilizes LLMs to
   interact with users or other agents and accomplish specific tasks.
   Take a multimodal AI agent as an example, it can collaborate with
   other domain-specific agents to complete diverse tasks such as
   translation, configuration generation, and API development.

   A2A provides a standardized way for AI agents to communicate and
   collaborate across different platforms and frameworks through a
   structured process, regardless of their underlying technologies.
   Agents can advertise their capabilities using an 'Agent Card' in JSON
   format, or send messages to communicate context, replies, artifacts,
   or user instructions, which make it easier to build AI applications
   that can interact with heterogeneous AI ecosystems in specific
   domain.

   With significant adoption of AI Agents across the Internet,Agent to
   Agent Communication protocol may become the foundation for the next
   wave of Internet communication technologies across domains
   [I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols].  The application of A2A in the network
   management field is meant to develop various rich AI driven network
   applications, realize intent based networks management automation in
   the multi-vendor heterogeneous network environment.  By establishing
   standard interfaces for dynamic Capability Discovery, intelligent
   message routing, heterogeneous AI ecosystems interaction,cross-
   platform collaboration, A2A enables AI Agents to:

   o Understand contextual nuances

   o Negotiate and adapt in real-time

   o Make collaborative decisions

   o Maintain persistent, intelligent interactions

   This document discusses the applicability of A2A to the network
   management in the multi-domain heterogeneous network environment that
   utilizes IETF technologies.  It explores operational aspect, key
   components, generic workflow and deployment scenarios.  The impact of
   integrating A2A into the network management system is also discussed.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   *  AI Agent: A software system or program that is capable of
      autonomously performing goals and tasks on behalf of a user or
      another system.

   *  Agent Card: A common metadata file that describes an agent's
      capabilities, skills, interface URLs, and authentication
      requirements.  Clients discover and identify the agent through
      this file.

   *  A2A Server: An AI agent that receives requests and performs tasks

   *  A2A Client: An AI agent that sends requests to servers

3.  Overview of key challenges for the network management

   In large scale network management environment, a large number of
   devices from different network vendors need to be uniformly managed,
   especially in the heterogeneous network environment which can lead to
   the following issues:

3.1.  Limitations of 3rd Party Management in Heterogeneous Network
      Environments

   In the multi-vendor heterogeneous environment,vendors implementations
   of YANG models and NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols [RFC6241][RFC8040]
   exhibit significant divergence.  Different vendors implement
   different YANG models such as IETF YANG, Openconfig YANG, Vendor
   specific YANG.  Some vendors only partially support standard Network
   management protocols while Other vendors might choose non-stanard
   network management protocol or telemetry protocol such as gnmi
   [I-D.openconfig-rtgwg-gnmi-spec], grpc
   [I-D.kumar-rtgwg-grpc-protocol].  Without standard protocol or open
   programmable framework with multi-vendors integration drivers,
   integration various different data models and management protocols
   and allowing quickly adapt to different device are still big
   challenges.  The same challenge is applied to multi-domain
   heterogeneous environment.

3.2.  Static Data Format or Data Model for Management Interface, Unable
      to Adapt to the Speed of Service Roll Out

   The IETF is currently working on and also publishing a set of YANG
   models for network service configuration.  Network Service
   configurations are built from a combination of network element and
   protocol configuration, but are specified to service users in more
   abstract terms, which enables service agility to speed service
   creation and delivery and allows the deployment of innovative new
   services across networks.  However Network service model provide
   static interface with a fixed, unchanging format, it is unable to
   adapt to new service requirements, e.g., when some new service
   attributes are introduced and correlated with the specific network
   service model A or knowledge graph B using RDF, it is hard to expose
   these new attributes or capability through the same management
   interface which is using network service model A.

3.3.  YANG Model Lacks integration with Open APIs

   Today, Open API has been widely adopted by the northbound interface
   of OSS/BSS or Network orchestrator while YANG data models have been
   widely adopted by the northbound interface of the network controller
   or the southbound interface of the network controller.  However Open
   API ecosystem and YANG model ecosystem are both built as silo and
   lack integration or mapping between them.

4.  Operational Consideration

   This section outlines operational aspects of A2A with Network
   management requirements as follows:

   *  _Dynamic Capability Discovery and Negotiation_: Agent can
      automatically detect and understand each other's capabilities,
      enabling more intelligent and adaptive interactions, e.g.,client
      and remote agents can negotiate the correct format needed.

   *  _Task Management_: The communication between a client and remote
      agent is oriented towards task completion and agents work to
      fulfill end-user requests.  The task object is defined by the
      protocol and has a lifecycle.  Each of the agents can communicate
      to stay in sync with each other on the latest status of completing
      a task.

   *  _Automated Workflow Coordination_: Agents comprehend high-level
      user intent,execute extended workflow sequences.  In addition,
      they enable more intelligent, context-aware agent interactions,
      e.g., Agents send each other messages to communicate context,
      replies, artifacts, or user instructions.

5.  Architecture Overview

   Large language models (LLMs) inherently excel at understanding
   complex user instructions, a capability that becomes even more
   pronounced in an AI agent-to-agent (A2A) architecture.  Beyond merely
   comprehending sophisticated requirements, they can autonomously
   orchestrate lengthy network management workflows, making them
   particularly suitable for large-scale network management scenarios.
   Therefore, we have introduced the A2A protocol in the network
   management environments for building an intelligent network
   management and control platform.

                +--------------------------------------------------+

   In the multi-agent communication deployment scenario, AI Agents can
   be deployed at both service layer and network layer,e.g., both
   service orchestrator and network controller can introduce AI Agent
   and allow Agent to Agent communication.  AI Agent within the service
   orchestrator can provide registry database for other service agents
   within the network controller to register its location.

   The interaction in the multi-agent communication deployment scenario
   can be break down into:

   *  _AI Agent to Agent interaction_

   *  _AI Agent to Tools interaction_

   For AI Agent to Tools interaction, to enable comprehensive
   functionality, additional protocol extensions are required to address
   two critical aspects: (1) standardized tool invocation mechanisms for
   agent-tool interoperability, and (2) monitoring frameworks for tool
   usage tracking and auditing.

   AI Agent to Agent interaction, users require a real-time monitoring
   interface for long-running workflows or tasks requiring continuous
   supervision with dual capabilities: (1) live network state
   observation and (2) validation of agent-proposed remediation actions
   during anomaly resolution scenarios.

   A general workflow is as follows:

   *  User Input Submission: An operator submits a natural language
      request to a central AI agent.

   *  Agent Intent Processing: The central AI agent processes natural
      language inputs by parsing instructions into structured tasks.

   *  Workflow Graph Decision: The central AI agent decomposing tasks
      into workflow graphs, and distributes subtasks via an Agent Card
      Registry to specialized subordinate agents based on their
      capabilities.

   *  Iteration continues until all tasks reach executable leaf tier
      agents in the hierarchy.

   *  Leaf agents report outcomes to the central agent, which
      dynamically adjusts the workflow based on result analysis and
      policy rules.

6.  Impact of integrating A2A on Network Management

6.1.  Agent to Agent Interaction

   A2A leverages advanced machine learning models or knowledge graph
   models and sophisticated communication protocols such as one built on
   top of HTTP, SSE, JSON-RPC.

   Unlike REST or NETCONF/RESTCONF [RFC6241][RFC8040], other open API
   that follow predefined, static request-response patterns, A2A
   introduces a more adaptive communication model which transforms these
   interactions into dynamic, context-aware conversations.

   In addition, Agents can now negotiate, interpret subtle contextual
   cues, and make collaborative decisions in real-time.  The cost is
   more context information needs to be kept as states in both sides.

6.2.  Agent to Tools Interaction

   In case of collaboration between small AI model in the network
   element and large AI model in the network controller, A2A can be used
   to negotiate more context related information and invoke the tools.
   The cost is more context information needs to be kept as states in
   both sides.

   In case of no lightweight AI in the network element, REST or NETCONF/
   RESTCONF, other open API is sufficient for network management.  There
   is no impact on management protocol used between the network element
   and the management system.

   If YANG2CLI script has been deployed in the network element, this
   script can be used to translate YANG schema into CLI command and
   mange the 3rd party network device.

7.  Security Considerations

   The communication between Agents for the exchange of context
   information, capability information and user instruction is security
   sensitive and requires authentication,authorization and integrity
   protection.  Legacy communication protocols such as HTTPS/TLS,
   designed for human-centric interactions, simply cannot withstand the
   high-speed exchanges between intelligent agents.  Key security
   challenges in AI agent communication include:

   *  Identity Verification: Ensuring that agents are who they claim to
      be

   *  Data Integrity: Preventing unauthorized modifications during
      transmission

   *  Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive information from potential
      breaches

   *  Scalable Security: Maintaining robust protection across diverse
      and complex networks

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

9.  Appendix I: Template preparation

   This appendix should be removed when the template will be stable.

   It is based on the example from https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/
   rfc9450/.

9.1.  Use Case Description

   General description of the use case.

9.2.  GREEN WG Charter Specifics

   (if there are no GREEN specific aspects, then it is not a UC to be
   documented) For example, the use case involves components that can
   report on energy consumption and that might be reconfigured (on a
   local or global scale) to operate based on energy goals/limitations.

9.2.1.  The Need for Energy Efficiency

9.3.  Requirements for GREEN

   Examples (can be split into different categories to facilitate a
   summary at the end of the document): - Granularity of measurements
   should be per component, per line, per port - Ability to switch on/
   off, put on sleep mode… components. - Ability to reconfigure hardware
   mode based on power savings (e.g., reduce reliability or speed). -
   Ability to operate globally (not constrained to just one device)
   based on power savings/goals (e.g., steer traffic using a different
   path that consumes less energy)

10.  Appendix II: Necessity and Impact of a Framework for Energy
     Efficiency Management

   This appendix outlines the necessity of defining a framework for
   energy efficiency management within the GREEN Working Group's current
   phase.  Establishing a framework now is crucial for standardizing
   processes, optimizing energy usage, and ensuring interoperability
   across network devices.  Immediate action enables the industry to
   achieve cost savings, meet regulatory requirements, and maintain
   competitiveness.  By utilizing insights from existing use cases, the
   framework can deliver actionable metrics and support ongoing
   innovation, positioning the industry to effectively manage future
   energy challenges.

10.1.  Framework Necessity

   Analyzing use cases such as the "Incremental Application of the GREEN
   Framework" reveals the critical need for a structured approach to
   transitioning network devices towards energy-efficient operations.
   The framework is essential for:

   *  *Standardization*: Ensuring consistent practices across different
      devices and network segments to facilitate interoperability.

   *  *Efficient Energy Management*: Providing guidelines to identify
      inefficiencies and implement improvements.

   *  *Scalability*: Offering solutions that accommodate growing network
      demands and complexity.

   *  *Cost Reduction*: Optimizing energy usage to lower operational
      costs and extend equipment lifecycles.

   *  *Competitiveness*: Enabling organizations to maintain a
      competitive edge through enhanced sustainability.

   *  *Environmental Impact*: Supporting broader sustainability
      initiatives by reducing carbon footprints.

   *  *Simplified Implementation*: Streamlining the deployment of
      energy-efficient measures to minimize service disruptions.

   *  *Security*: Protecting sensitive operations related to power
      states and consumption.

10.2.  Use Cases Calling for a Framework

   Multiple use cases underscore the need for a framework, including:

   *  *Incremental Application of the GREEN Framework*

   *  *Selective Reduction of Energy Consumption in Network Parts*

   *  *Real-time Energy Metering of Virtualized or Cloud-native Network
      Functions*

   *  *Indirect Energy Monitoring and Control*

   *  *Consideration of Other Domains for Obtention of End-to-End
      Metrics*

   *  *Dynamic Adjustment of Network Element Throughput*

   *  *Video Streaming Use Case*

   *  *WLAN Network Energy Saving*

   *  *Fixed Network Energy Saving*

   *  *Energy Efficiency Network Management*

   These use cases highlight diverse aspects of energy management that
   require a cohesive framework for effective implementation.

10.3.  Impact on Energy Metrics

   The framework will significantly enhance the creation of energy
   metrics with actionable insights by:

   *  *Standardizing Metrics*: Establishing consistent measurement
      protocols for energy consumption and efficiency.

   *  *Enhancing Data Collection*: Facilitating comprehensive monitoring
      and data aggregation across devices.

   *  *Supporting Real-time Monitoring*: Enabling dynamic tracking and
      immediate optimization of energy usage.

   *  *Integration Across Devices*: Ensuring interoperability for
      network-wide data analysis.

   *  *Providing Actionable Insights*: Translating raw data into
      meaningful information for decision-making.

10.4.  Current Device Readiness

   While many modern networking devices have basic energy monitoring
   capabilities, these are often proprietary.  The framework will define
   requirements to enhance these capabilities, enabling standardized
   metric production and meaningful data contributions for energy
   management goals.

10.5.  Why Now?

   The decision to define the framework now, rather than later, is
   driven by:

   *  *Immediate Benefits*: Start realizing cost savings, reduced carbon
      footprints, and improved efficiencies.

   *  *Rapid Technological Advancements*: Aligning the framework with
      current technologies to prevent obsolescence.

   *  *Increasing Energy Demands*: Mitigating the impact of growing
      energy consumption on costs and sustainability.

   *  *Regulatory Pressure*: Preparing for compliance with existing and
      anticipated sustainability regulations.

   *  *Competitive Advantage*: Positioning organizations as leaders in
      sustainability and innovation.

   *  *Foundational Work Ready*: Building on the use cases and
      requirements established in Phase I.

   *  *Proactive Risk Management*: Minimizing risks associated with
      energy costs and environmental factors.

   *  *Facilitate Future Innovations*: Creating a platform for
      continuous improvements and adaptations.

   *  *Stakeholder Engagement*: Ensuring diverse perspectives are
      reflected for broader adoption.

   In conclusion, establishing the framework for energy efficiency
   management now is strategic and timely, leveraging the current
   momentum of use cases and requirements to drive meaningful progress
   in energy efficiency management.  Delaying its development could
   result in missed opportunities for immediate benefits, increased
   costs, and challenges in adapting to future technological and
   regulatory landscapes.
