1.  Introduction

   With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the concept of
   AI agents has gradually attracted significant attention.  An AI agent
   refers to a category of software applications that utilizes LLMs to
   interact with users or other agents and accomplish specific tasks.
   Take a multimodal AI agent as an example, it can collaborate with
   other domain-specific agents to complete diverse tasks such as
   translation, configuration generation, and API development.

   A2A provides a standardized way for AI agents to communicate and
   collaborate across different platforms and frameworks through a
   structured process, regardless of their underlying technologies.
   Agents can advertise their capabilities using an 'Agent Card' in JSON
   format, or send messages to communicate context, replies, artifacts,
   or user instructions, which make it easier to build AI applications
   that can interact with heterogeneous AI ecosystems in specific
   domains.

   With significant adoption of AI Agents across the Internet, Agent to
   Agent Communication protocol may become the foundation for the next
   wave of Internet communication technologies across domains
   [I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols].  The application of A2A in the network
   management field is meant to develop various rich AI driven network
   applications, realize intent based networks management automation in
   the multi-vendor heterogeneous network environment.  By establishing
   standard interfaces for dynamic Capability Discovery, intelligent
   message routing, heterogeneous AI ecosystems interaction, cross-
   platform collaboration, A2A enables AI Agents to:

   o Understand contextual nuances

   o Negotiate and adapt in real-time

   o Make collaborative decisions

   o Maintain persistent, intelligent interactions

   This document discusses the applicability of A2A to the network
   management in the multi-domain heterogeneous network environment that
   utilizes IETF technologies.  It explores operational aspect, key
   components, generic workflow and deployment scenarios.  The impact of
   integrating A2A into the network management system is also discussed.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   *  AI Agent: A software system or program that is capable of
      autonomously performing goals and tasks on behalf of a user or
      another system.

   *  Agent Card: A common metadata file that describes an agent's
      capabilities, skills, interface URLs, and authentication
      requirements.  Clients discover and identify the agent through
      this file.

   *  A2A Server: An AI agent that receives requests and performs tasks

   *  A2A Client: An AI agent that sends requests to servers

3.  Overview of key challenges for the network management

   As described in [I-D.wmz-nmrg-agent-ndt-arch], 3 key challenges to
   apply A2A protocol to network management have been listed:

   o High Risk Operations of Agent2Agent interaction High risk operation
   can can to large-scale network outages.

   o The timeliness requirement of Agent2Agent collaboration "Token-
   based" generation and reasoning approach, limited by computing power
   and algorithms, result in slow reasoning speeds. task-oriented
   "request-response" model without event subscription is unlike to meet
   time constraints for tasks such as fault diagnosis, complaint
   handling, and user experience improvement.

   o The Agent2agent Collaboration Reliability Incorrect or outdated
   network configuration data results in incorrect repair advice when
   diagnosing network incidents or faults. task collaboration is
   incomplete or not sufficient to handle strategies such as task
   rejection, missing information during task collaboration, and failure
   to achieve task objectives.

4.  Architecture Overview

   Large language models (LLMs) inherently excel at understanding
   complex user instructions, a capability that becomes even more
   pronounced in an AI agent-to-agent (A2A) architecture.  Beyond merely
   comprehending sophisticated requirements, they can autonomously
   orchestrate lengthy network management workflows, making them
   particularly suitable for large-scale network management scenarios.
   Therefore, we have introduced the A2A protocol in the network
   management environments for building an intelligent network
   management and control platform.

   In the multi-agent communication deployment scenario, AI Agents can
   be deployed at both service layer and network layer, e.g., both
   service orchestrator and network controller can introduce AI Agent
   and allow Agent to Agent communication.  AI Agent within the service
   orchestrator can provide registry database for other service agents
   within the network controller to register its location.

   The interaction in the multi-agent communication deployment scenario
   can be broken down into:

   *  _AI Agent to Agent interaction_

   *  _AI Agent to Tools interaction_

   For AI Agent to Tools interaction, to enable comprehensive
   functionality, additional protocol extensions are required to address
   two critical aspects: (1) standardized tool invocation mechanisms for
   agent-tool interoperability, and (2) monitoring frameworks for tool
   usage tracking and auditing.

   AI Agent to Agent interaction, users require a real-time monitoring
   interface for long-running workflows or tasks requiring continuous
   supervision with dual capabilities: (1) live network state
   observation and (2) validation of agent-proposed remediation actions
   during anomaly resolution scenarios.

   A general workflow is as follows:

   *  User Input Submission: An operator submits a natural language
      request to a central AI agent.

   *  Agent Intent Processing: The central AI agent processes natural
      language inputs by parsing instructions into structured tasks.

   *  Workflow Graph Decision: The central AI agent decomposing tasks
      into workflow graphs, and distributes subtasks via an Agent Card
      Registry to specialized subordinate agents based on their
      capabilities.

   *  Iteration continues until all tasks reach executable leaf tier
      agents in the hierarchy.

   *  Leaf agents report outcomes to the central agent, which
      dynamically adjusts the workflow based on result analysis and
      policy rules.

4.2.  Example

   This section describes the deployment of a network configuration
   within a secure video meeting context.  The scheduling agent is
   deployed to the Service Orchestrator, while the worker agent is
   deployed to the network controller.  Registered on the Service
   Orchestrator, the agent card formally defines a worker agent's
   capabilities, interfaces, and operational characteristics within
   network management systems.

   See the following Agent card examples for two worker agents (QoS
   Agent and Security Agent):

 # Worker Agents Capabilities
 {
     "name": "QoSAgent",
     "description": "Automatically configure QoS policies",
     "url": "https://qos-agent.example.com/tasks/send",
     "capabilities": ["QoS_Policy"],
     "skills": [
         {
             "id": "set_qos",
             "name": "QoS configuration",
             "description": "QoS configuration",
             "inputModes": ["text/structured"],
             "outputModes": ["text/status"]
         }
     ]
 }
 {
     "name": "SecurityAgent",
     "description": "Automatically configure network security policies",
     "url": "https://security-agent.example.com/tasks/send",
     "capabilities": ["IPSEC", "DTLS"],
     "skills": [
         {
             "id": "enable_encryption",
             "name": "Encryption method configuration",
             "description": "Encryption method configuration",
             "inputModes": ["text/structured"],
             "outputModes": ["text/status"]
         }
     ]
 }

   Suppose a user submits a natural language request such as "The
   meeting will have 100 participants.  The security level is Top
   Secret" to the platform integrated with the Service Orchestrator.
   The platform parses the request and converts it into JSON format as
   follows:

   # Requested Service Configuration
   {
       "taskId": "task-multi-001",
       "action": "deploy_network_configuration",
       "parameters": {
           "context": "secure_video_meeting",
           "scope": "100",
           "secure_level": "Top Secret",
       }
   }

   The Service Orchestrator sends subtasks in a structured format to the
   Network Controller.  For example, the subtasks for set_qos and
   enable_encryption are structured as follows:

   # Set QoS and Enable Encryption Subtasks
   {
       "taskId": "task-multi-001",
       "subTasks": [
           {
               "agent": "QoSAgent",
               "action": "set_qos",
               "parameters": {
                       "configuration": {
                               "acceptedOutputModes": [
                                       "text/status"
                       ]
                       },
                       "minimum_bandwidth": "100Mbps",
                       "priority": "0"
               }
           },
           {
               "agent": "SecurityAgent",
               "action": "enable_encryption",
               "parameters": {
                       "configuration": {
                               "acceptedOutputModes": [
                                       "text/status"
                       ]
                       },
                       "encryption_method": "ipsec",
                       "key_management": "dtls",
               }
           }
       ]
   }

   The network controller executes network management operations on
   network devices and returns the results to the Service Orchestrator
   in JSON format.  Example responses for the subtasks are shown below:

# Network Configuration Feedback Results
{
    "taskId": "task-multi-001",
    "action": "deploy_network_configuration",
    "parameters": {
        "context": "secure_video_meeting",
        "scope": "100",
        "secure_level": "Top Secret",
    }
}
{
  "taskId": "subtask-qos-001",
  "status": "completed",
  "artifacts": [{"type": "text", "content": "QoS setup completed"}]
}
{
  "taskId": "subtask-sec-001",
  "status": "completed",
  "artifacts": [{"type": "text", "content": "IPSEC encryption enabled"}]
}

5.  Impact of integrating A2A on Network Management

5.1.  Agent to Agent Interaction

   A2A leverages advanced machine learning models or knowledge graph
   models and sophisticated communication protocols such as one built on
   top of HTTP, SSE, JSON-RPC.

   Unlike REST or NETCONF/RESTCONF [RFC6241][RFC8040], other open API
   that follow predefined, static request-response patterns, A2A
   introduces a more adaptive communication model which transforms these
   interactions into dynamic, context-aware conversations.

   In addition, Agents can now negotiate, interpret subtle contextual
   cues, and make collaborative decisions in real-time.  The cost is
   more context information needs to be kept as states in both sides.

5.2.  Agent to Tools Interaction

   In case of collaboration between small AI model in the network
   element and large AI model in the network controller, A2A can be used
   to negotiate more context related information and invoke the tools.
   The cost is more context information needs to be kept as states in
   both sides.

   In case of no lightweight AI in the network element, REST or NETCONF/
   RESTCONF, other open API is sufficient for network management.  There
   is no impact on management protocol used between the network element
   and the management system.

   If YANG2CLI script has been deployed in the network element, this
   script can be used to translate YANG schema into CLI command and
   manage the 3rd party network device.

6.  Operational Considerations

   The introduction of A2A-based agent interactions into network
   management has several operational implications that MUST be
   considered when deploying the architecture in large-scale or multi-
   domain networks.  This section highlights key aspects related to
   performance, scalability, reliability, latency, and agent lifecycle
   operations.

6.1.  Scalability

   Large operational networks may contain tens of thousands of devices,
   multiple administrative domains, and a distributed set of controllers
   and orchestrators.  The use of conversational, context-rich A2A
   messaging increases message volume compared to static RPC-based
   interfaces such as NETCONF or RESTCONF.

   Operators should evaluate:

   *  The number of agents required per domain or per function.

   *  The expected message growth as workflows involve multiple agents
      performing negotiation, capability discovery, and state exchange.

   *  The impact of concurrent multi-agent workflows on control-plane
      stability.

   *  Whether hierarchical or federated agent structures are needed to
      avoid message storms and to localize decisions.

   Mechanisms for rate-limiting, backoff, and prioritization may be
   needed to prevent overload.

6.2.  Latency and Performance Constraints

   Task decomposition and negotiation across multiple agents can
   introduce non-trivial latency, especially when agents rely on
   external AI inference engines or large language models (LLMs).

   Operational environments may impose strict timing requirements, for
   example during:

   *  Service activation with customer-facing SLAs.

   *  Fault detection and automated remediation loops.

   *  Real-time telemetry-driven control such as congestion mitigation.

   Implementations SHOULD define performance envelopes, including:

   *  Maximum agent-to-agent message processing latency.

   *  Timeout and retry behavior for workflow steps.

   *  Acceptable degradation under load or partial failures.

   Fallback mechanisms (e.g., reverting to direct controller APIs or
   static policies) SHOULD be provided when A2A interactions cannot meet
   timing constraints.

6.3.  Reliability and Failure Handling

   A2A workflows may involve long-lived tasks that span multiple agents
   and systems.  Operational networks require predictable and safe
   behavior under partial failures.

   Operators SHOULD consider:

   *  How workflow state is checkpointed or restored if an agent becomes
      unreachable.

   *  How to detect and mitigate inconsistent or stale agent state.

   *  Whether workflows can be retried idempotently.

   *  Requirements for transactionality or rollback comparable to
      NETCONF confirmed-commit semantics.

   Implementations SHOULD include mechanisms for workflow monitoring,
   circuit-breakers, and automatic escalation to human operators in case
   of sustained failure.

6.4.  Agent Lifecycle and Resource Management

   Production deployment of A2A-based systems requires active management
   of agent lifecycles, including:

   *  Agent onboarding and registration.

   *  Updates and model re-training (for AI-driven agents).

   *  Decommissioning and revocation of compromised agents.

   *  Resource consumption limits for CPU, memory, and inference
      workloads.

   Operators SHOULD maintain visibility into the operational state of
   all agents and their dependencies, including telemetry on message
   rates, errors, and workflow completion metrics.

6.5.  Inter-Domain Operational Challenges

   In multi-domain scenarios (e.g., between business units, operators,
   or federated networks), operational concerns are amplified due to:

   *  Differences in local policies or SLAs.

   *  Variations in controller capabilities and data models.

   *  Latency and reliability across administrative boundaries.

   *  Need for shared or interoperable agent capability descriptions.

   Standardized operational practices MAY be required for agent
   discovery, trust establishment, conflict resolution, and
   accountability.

7.  Security Considerations

   The communication between Agents for the exchange of context
   information, capability information and user instruction is security
   sensitive and requires authentication, authorization, and integrity
   protection.  Legacy communication protocols such as HTTPS/TLS,
   designed for human-centric interactions, simply cannot withstand the
   high-speed exchanges between intelligent agents.  Key security
   challenges in AI agent communication include:

   *  Identity Verification: Ensuring that agents are who they claim to
      be

   *  Data Integrity: Preventing unauthorized modifications during
      transmission

   *  Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive information from potential
      breaches

   *  Scalable Security: Maintaining robust protection across diverse
      and complex networks
