1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   *  AI Agent: A software system or program that is capable of
      autonomously performing goals and tasks on behalf of a user or
      another system.

   *  Agent Card: A common metadata file that describes an agent's
      capabilities, skills, interface URLs, and authentication
      requirements.  Clients discover and identify the agent through
      this file.

   *  A2A server: An AI agent that receives requests and performs tasks

   *  A2A client: An AI agent that sends requests to servers

3.  Overview of key challenges for the network management

   In large scale network management environment, a large number of
   devices from different vendors need to be uniformly managed, which
   can lead to the following issues:

3.1.  Limitations of Unified AI Agents in Heterogeneous NETCONF/YANG
      Environments

   Vendor implementations of YANG models and NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols
   exhibit significant divergence.  A unified AI agent trained with
   homogeneous datasets and operating within fixed contextual frameworks
   inherently fails to adapt to vendor-specific device behaviors,
   resulting in suboptimal management performance, primarily due to:

   *  *Overgeneralized Training Data*: Single training corpus cannot
      capture all vendor implementations

   *  *Inflexible Contextual Frameworks*: Static operational contexts
      cannot accommodate device-specific nuances

3.2.  Operational Inefficiencies in Multi-Device Management Scenarios

   In multi-device operational environments, critical workflows
   including:

   *  Fault diagnosis

   *  Traffic monitoring

   *  Security enforcement

   often require engineers to:

   *  Manually collect and correlate logs across devices

   *  Perform root cause analysis without cross-device context

   *  Validate solutions through iterative device-by-device testing

   *  Act as human intermediaries for inter-device communication

   This approach introduces significant operational inefficiencies and
   suboptimal human resource utilization.

4.  Problem Statemtent

5.  Operational Consideration

6.  Conclusion

7.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
