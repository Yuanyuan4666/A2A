1.  Introduction

   With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the concept of
   AI agents has gradually attracted significant attention.  An AI agent
   refers to a category of software applications that utilizes LLMs to
   interact with users or other agents and accomplish specific tasks.
   Some examples of AI agents are:

   *  A fitness AI agent that recommends suitable physical activities
      for users based on users' health conditions, geographical
      locations, weather, and wind factors.

   *  A multimodal AI agent that collaborates with domain-specific
      agents to complete diverse tasks such as translation, image
      generation, and video production."

   Fundamentally, an AI agent is developed based on large language
   models (LLMs), with its prompt engineering varying according to its
   specialized domain.  Sophisticated prompts typically incorporate:

   *  Domain-specific documentation

   *  Available tools and capabilities

   *  Function callings (in some cases)

   *  User-provided inputs

   Based on this comprehensive prompt structure, the LLM dynamically
   determines subsequent actions, which may involve continuing dialogue
   with users to gather additional information, invoking appropriate
   tools to execute specific functions, or initiating interactions with
   other specialized agents.

   The aforementioned examples demonstrate that AI agents are typically
   domain-specific, which raises an important challenge: users may
   request an agent to perform tasks beyond its specialized
   capabilities.  In such cases, a more effective solution involves
   enabling the current agent to communicate with other agents and
   delegate tasks to better-suited counterparts.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   *  AI Agent: A software system or program that is capable of
      autonomously performing goals and tasks on behalf of a user or
      another system.

   *  Agent Card: A common metadata file that describes an agent's
      capabilities, skills, interface URLs, and authentication
      requirements.  Clients discover and identify the agent through
      this file.

   *  A2A server: An AI agent that receives requests and performs tasks

   *  A2A client: An AI agent that sends requests to servers

3.  Overview of key challenges for the network management

   In large scale network management environment, a large number of
   devices from different vendors need to be uniformly managed, which
   can lead to the following issues:

3.1.  Limitations of Unified AI Agents in Heterogeneous NETCONF/YANG
      Environments

   Vendor implementations of YANG models and NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols
   exhibit significant divergence.  A unified AI agent trained with
   homogeneous datasets and operating within fixed contextual frameworks
   inherently fails to adapt to vendor-specific device behaviors,
   resulting in suboptimal management performance, primarily due to:

   *  *Overgeneralized Training Data*: Single training corpus cannot
      capture all vendor implementations

   *  *Inflexible Contextual Frameworks*: Static operational contexts
      cannot accommodate device-specific nuances

3.2.  Operational Inefficiencies in Multi-Device Management Scenarios

   In multi-device operational environments, critical workflows
   including:

   *  Fault diagnosis

   *  Traffic monitoring

   *  Security enforcement

   often require engineers to:

   *  Manually collect and correlate logs across devices

   *  Perform root cause analysis without cross-device context

   *  Validate solutions through iterative device-by-device testing

   *  Act as human intermediaries for inter-device communication

   This approach introduces significant operational inefficiencies and
   suboptimal human resource utilization.

5.  Conclusion

6.  Security Considerations

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Operational Need

   This section outlines operational aspects of A2A with Network
   management requirements as follows:

   *  _Domain-Specific AI Agents_: For appropriately scoped domains,
      high-quality domain-specific training data yields optimally
      performing agents that demonstrate superior effectiveness within
      their target operational environments.

   *  _Information Security_: All AI agents must employ either
      standardized encryption formats or data anonymization techniques
      to ensure secure information transmission.  These measures shall
      guarantee communication confidentiality, protect sensitive data
      elements, and maintain privacy preservation requirements across
      all inter-agent exchanges.

   *  _Automated Workflow Capabilities_: The system shall demonstrate
      the ability to: (1) comprehend high-level user intent, (2) execute
      extended workflow sequences, and (3) implement cross-verification
      mechanisms throughout prolonged operations to mitigate error
      accumulation, semantic drift, and hallucination propagation
      phenomena.
