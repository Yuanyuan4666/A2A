1.  Introduction

   With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the concept of
   AI agents has gradually attracted significant attention.  An AI agent
   refers to a category of software applications that utilizes LLMs to
   interact with users or other agents and accomplish specific tasks.
   Take a multimodal AI agent as an example, it can collaborate with
   other domain-specific agents to complete diverse tasks such as
   translation, configuration generation, and API development.

   A2A provides a standardized way for AI agents to communicate and
   collaborate across different platforms and frameworks through a
   structured process, regardless of their underlying technologies.
   Agents can advertise their capabilities using an 'Agent Card' in JSON
   format, or send messages to communicate context, replies, artifacts,
   or user instructions, which make it easier to build AI applications
   that can interact with heterogeneous AI ecosystems in specific
   domains.

   With significant adoption of AI Agents across the Internet, Agent to
   Agent Communication protocol may become the foundation for the next
   wave of Internet communication technologies across domains
   [I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols].  The application of A2A in the network
   management field is meant to develop various rich AI driven network
   applications, realize intent based networks management automation in
   the multi-vendor heterogeneous network environment.  By establishing
   standard interfaces for dynamic Capability Discovery, intelligent
   message routing, heterogeneous AI ecosystems interaction, cross-
   platform collaboration, A2A enables AI Agents to:

   o Understand contextual nuances

   o Negotiate and adapt in real-time

   o Make collaborative decisions

   o Maintain persistent, intelligent interactions

   This document discusses the applicability of A2A to the network
   management in the multi-domain heterogeneous network environment that
   utilizes IETF technologies.  It explores operational aspect, key
   components, generic workflow and deployment scenarios.  The impact of
   integrating A2A into the network management system is also discussed.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   *  AI Agent: A software system or program that is capable of
      autonomously performing goals and tasks on behalf of a user or
      another system.

   *  Agent Card: A common metadata file that describes an agent's
      capabilities, skills, interface URLs, and authentication
      requirements.  Clients discover and identify the agent through
      this file.

   *  A2A Server: An AI agent that receives requests and performs tasks

   *  A2A Client: An AI agent that sends requests to servers

3.  Overview of key challenges for the network management

   As described in [I-D.wmz-nmrg-agent-ndt-arch], 3 key challenges to
   apply A2A protocol to network management have been listed:

   o High Risk Operations of Agent2Agent interaction

   *  High risk operation can can to large-scale network outages.

   o The timeliness requirement of Agent2Agent collaboration

   *  "Token-based" generation and reasoning approach, limited by
      computing power and algorithms, result in slow reasoning speeds.

   *  Task-oriented "request-response" model without event subscription
      is unlike to meet time constraints for tasks such as fault
      diagnosis, complaint handling, and user experience improvement.

   o The Agent2agent Collaboration Reliability

   *  Incorrect or outdated network configuration data results in
      incorrect repair advice when diagnosing network incidents or
      faults.

   *  Task collaboration is incomplete or not sufficient to handle
      strategies such as task rejection, missing information during task
      collaboration, and failure to achieve task objectives.

   +-------------------  Smart Network Element---------------------+

   As described in [I-D.wmz-nmrg-agent-ndt-arch], in the multi-agent
   communication deployment scenario, AI Agents can be deployed at both
   service layer,network layer and Network Element Level, e.g., both
   service orchestrator and network controller can introduce AI Agent
   and allow Agent to Agent communication.  Service AI Agent within the
   service orchestrator can provide registration center for other
   network AI agents and task agents within the network controller to
   register its location.  In the meanwhile Network AI Agent within the
   network Controller can provide registration center for task agents at
   the network level and Network element level AI agent within the smart
   network element.

   The interaction in the multi-agent communication deployment scenario
   can be broken down into:

   *  _AI Agent to Agent interaction_

   *  _AI Agent to Tools/APIs/Models interaction_

   For AI Agent to Tools/APIs/Models interaction, to enable
   comprehensive functionality (e.g., large AI model and small AI model
   collaboration, network AI agent and Network element AI agent
   collaboration for routing protocol troubleshooting), additional
   protocol extensions are required to address two critical aspects: (1)
   standardized tool invocation mechanisms for agent-tool/api/model
   interoperability, and (2) monitoring frameworks for tool usage
   tracking and auditing.

   AI Agent to Agent interaction, human operators require a real-time
   monitoring interface for long-running workflows or tasks requiring
   continuous supervision with dual capabilities: (1) live network state
   observation and (2) validation of agent-proposed remediation actions
   during anomaly resolution scenarios.

   A general workflow is as follows:

   *  User Input Submission: An operator submits a natural language
      request to a Service AI agent.

   *  Agent Intent Processing: The service AI agent processes natural
      language inputs by parsing instructions into structured tasks.

   *  Autonomous Close Loop Workflow Management: The service AI agent
      decomposing tasks into workflow map with subtasks, and distributes
      subtasks via an Agent Card Registry to specialized task agents
      based on their capabilities.

   *  Task Execution: Iteration continues until all tasks reach
      executable task agents in the hierarchy.

   *  Task Report: Task agents report outcomes to the central agent,
      which dynamically adjusts the workflow based on result analysis
      and policy rules.

5.  Operational Considerations

   The introduction of A2A-based agent interactions into network
   management has several operational implications that MUST be
   considered when deploying the architecture in large-scale or multi-
   domain networks.  This section highlights key aspects related to
   performance, scalability, reliability, latency, and agent lifecycle
   operations.

5.1.  Agent Skills as Expertise Expansion of AI Agents

   While AI agents have intelligence and capabilities, they may not
   always have expertise that we expect when performing specific network
   management and operation tasks.  Agent Skills [Agent-skills],
   introduced by Anthropic, is an open standard that allows developers
   to package specialized knowledge, workflow, and scripts and empowers
   a general AI Agent to become an expert in a specified field.  Each
   skill is organized as a seperate folder that consists of a "skill.md"
   to define the basic information of the skill, and other files such as
   scripts, reference documents, etc.  Agent Skills use progressive
   disclosure as a design pattern to load these resources to reduce
   token consumption and use less of the context window.

   Network operators could encode their domain expertise (e.g.,
   troubleshooting workflow logic for fault scenarios) into structured
   skills, e.g., by defining the fault_diagnose_link skill to organize
   the logic of "checking link connectivity → analyzing error syslogs →
   verifying hardware status → outputting a resolution solution"), it
   quickly equips AI Agents with domain expertise.

5.2.  Knowledge Base as Ground Truth Data to Mitigate Hallucination

   The knowledge base for agentic system is a structured, machine-
   interpretable repository that aggregates all domain knowledge,
   network rules, operational specifications, expert experience,
   decision logic, and historical experience related to network
   management.  Its core role in the A2A operational process is defined
   by its ability to eliminate information asymmetry between
   heterogeneous Agents—such as monitoring, control, and analysis
   Agents—ensuring that all Agents base their judgments and actions on
   consistent knowledge standards to avoid miscommunication or
   inconsistent operations stemming from divergent understandings of
   network rules.  Beyond establishing unified criteria, the KB provides
   pre-defined decision logic and adaptive inference rules that enable
   Agents to complete simple decision-making tasks, such as threshold-
   based anomaly alarms, and collaborate on complex ones, including root
   cause analysis of network faults, without reliance on centralized
   control nodes, aligning with the distributed core of the A2A
   architecture.  Additionally, the KB functions as a driver of
   continuous operational optimization by integrating historical
   interaction data, fault handling records, and network evolution
   information from the A2A system, with iterative knowledge updates
   achieved through self-learning or manual calibration to adapt the
   Agent’s operational capabilities to dynamic network changes, such as
   expansion, service upgrades, and new fault types.  Throughout the
   entire A2A operational lifecycle, the KB is not a static resource but
   a dynamic core that permeates Agent initialization, communication
   interaction, decision execution, and result feedback, making full-
   link KB management a prerequisite for effective A2A system
   operational design.

5.3.  Event-driven Agent to Agent Communication

   The event-driven Agent to Agent communication enhances the task-based
   A2A procotol to support proactive and real-time communication based
   on network events.  By leveraging the Message Broker such as Apache
   Kafka to facilitate the exchange of event messages among different AI
   agents, it allows the real-time response to maintain network
   reliability and service assurance in network management and
   operations.  Figure 1 gives an overview of the architecure.

         +---------+                               +----------+
         |         |      Agent to Agent           |          |
         |AI Agent <-------------------------------> AI Agent |
         |         |                               |          |
         +---+-----+                               +-----^----+
             |                                           |
             | Events                                    | Events
             |           +----------------+              |
             +----------->Messaging topics|--------------+
                         +----------------+

               Figure 1: An Architecture for Event-driven A2A

   The event-driven extension introduces a publish/subscribe paradigm
   alongside the primary task-driven interaction.  For example, a "Fault
   Agent" identifies a link failure by data analyzing and publishes a
   message to the Message Broker, the "recovery agent" subscribes to the
   topic and it could initiate a task to generate recovery strategies
   such as link switching and traffic rerouting and submit to the
   operator for approval upon consuming the message.

5.4.  Scalability

   Large operational networks may contain tens of thousands of devices,
   multiple administrative domains, and a distributed set of controllers
   and orchestrators.  The use of conversational, context-rich A2A
   messaging increases message volume compared to static RPC-based
   interfaces such as NETCONF or RESTCONF.

   Operators should evaluate:

   *  The number of agents required per domain or per function.

   *  The expected message growth as workflows involve multiple agents
      performing negotiation, capability discovery, and state exchange.

   *  The impact of concurrent multi-agent workflows on control-plane
      stability.

   *  Whether hierarchical or federated agent structures are needed to
      avoid message storms and to localize decisions.

   Mechanisms for rate-limiting, backoff, and prioritization may be
   needed to prevent overload.

5.5.  Latency and Performance Constraints

   Task decomposition and negotiation across multiple agents can
   introduce non-trivial latency, especially when agents rely on
   external AI inference engines or large language models (LLMs).

   Operational environments may impose strict timing requirements, for
   example during:

   *  Service activation with customer-facing SLAs.

   *  Fault detection and automated remediation loops.

   *  Real-time telemetry-driven control such as congestion mitigation.

   Implementations SHOULD define performance envelopes, including:

   *  Maximum agent-to-agent message processing latency.

   *  Timeout and retry behavior for workflow steps.

   *  Acceptable degradation under load or partial failures.

   Fallback mechanisms (e.g., reverting to direct controller APIs or
   static policies) SHOULD be provided when A2A interactions cannot meet
   timing constraints.

5.6.  Reliability and Failure Handling

   A2A workflows may involve long-lived tasks that span multiple agents
   and systems.  Operational networks require predictable and safe
   behavior under partial failures.

   Operators SHOULD consider:

   *  How workflow state is checkpointed or restored if an agent becomes
      unreachable.

   *  How to detect and mitigate inconsistent or stale agent state.

   *  Whether workflows can be retried idempotently.

   *  Requirements for transactionality or rollback comparable to
      NETCONF confirmed-commit semantics.

   Implementations SHOULD include mechanisms for workflow monitoring,
   circuit-breakers, and automatic escalation to human operators in case
   of sustained failure.

5.7.  Agent Lifecycle and Resource Management

   Production deployment of A2A-based systems requires active management
   of agent lifecycles, including:

   *  Agent onboarding and registration.

   *  Updates and model re-training (for AI-driven agents).

   *  Decommissioning and revocation of compromised agents.

   *  Resource consumption limits for CPU, memory, and inference
      workloads.

   Operators SHOULD maintain visibility into the operational state of
   all agents and their dependencies, including telemetry on message
   rates, errors, and workflow completion metrics.

5.8.  Inter-Domain Operational Challenges

   In multi-domain scenarios (e.g., between business units, operators,
   or federated networks), operational concerns are amplified due to:

   *  Differences in local policies or SLAs.

   *  Variations in controller capabilities and data models.

   *  Latency and reliability across administrative boundaries.

   *  Need for shared or interoperable agent capability descriptions.

   Standardized operational practices MAY be required for agent
   discovery, trust establishment, conflict resolution, and
   accountability.

6.  Security Considerations

   The communication between Agents for the exchange of context
   information, capability information and user instruction is security
   sensitive and requires authentication, authorization, and integrity
   protection.  Legacy communication protocols such as HTTPS/TLS,
   designed for human-centric interactions, simply cannot withstand the
   high-speed exchanges between intelligent agents.  Key security
   challenges in AI agent communication include:

   *  Identity Verification: Ensuring that agents are who they claim to
      be

   *  Data Integrity: Preventing unauthorized modifications during
      transmission

   *  Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive information from potential
      breaches

   *  Scalable Security: Maintaining robust protection across diverse
      and complex networks

7.  IANA Considerations

             "outputModes": ["text/status"]
         }
     ]
 }

   Suppose a user submits a natural language request such as "The
   meeting will have 100 participants.  The security level is Top
   Secret" to the platform integrated with the Service Orchestrator.
   The platform parses the request and converts it into JSON format as
   follows:

   # Requested Service Configuration
   {
       "taskId": "task-multi-001",
       "action": "deploy_network_configuration",
       "parameters": {
           "context": "secure_video_meeting",
           "scope": "100",
           "secure_level": "Top Secret",
       }
   }

   The Service Orchestrator sends subtasks in a structured format to the
   Network Controller.  For example, the subtasks for set_qos and
   enable_encryption are structured as follows:

   # Set QoS and Enable Encryption Subtasks
   {
       "taskId": "task-multi-001",
       "subTasks": [
           {
               "agent": "QoSAgent",
               "action": "set_qos",
               "parameters": {
                       "configuration": {
                               "acceptedOutputModes": [
                                       "text/status"
                       ]
                       },
                       "minimum_bandwidth": "100Mbps",
                       "priority": "0"
               }
           },
           {
               "agent": "SecurityAgent",
               "action": "enable_encryption",
               "parameters": {
                       "configuration": {
                               "acceptedOutputModes": [
                                       "text/status"
                       ]
                       },
                       "encryption_method": "ipsec",
                       "key_management": "dtls",
               }
           }
       ]
   }

   The network controller executes network management operations on
   network devices and returns the results to the Service Orchestrator
   in JSON format.  Example responses for the subtasks are shown below:

# Network Configuration Feedback Results
{
    "taskId": "task-multi-001",
    "action": "deploy_network_configuration",
    "parameters": {
        "context": "secure_video_meeting",
        "scope": "100",
        "secure_level": "Top Secret",
    }
}
{
  "taskId": "subtask-qos-001",
  "status": "completed",
  "artifacts": [{"type": "text", "content": "QoS setup completed"}]
}
{
  "taskId": "subtask-sec-001",
  "status": "completed",
  "artifacts": [{"type": "text", "content": "IPSEC encryption enabled"}]
}
